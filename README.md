# images-to-base64

This script does one thing, it converts images in the `inputs` folder to base64-encoded `.txt` files in the `outputs` folder.

It uses [Deno](https://deno.land/) so that it can be as fast as possible.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:f-o-w-l/images-to-base64.git
cd images-to-base64
asdf install
```

## Usage

`pnpm convert`
